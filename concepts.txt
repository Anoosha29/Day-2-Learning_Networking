Networking 

Today I learned the following key networking concepts:

1. Domain Name:
 A domain name is the easy-to-remember name of a website (example: google.com).
 It translates human-friendly names into machine-friendly IP addresses.
 Without domain names, users would have to memorize complex IP addresses.

2. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
 An IP address is the real digital address of a device on the internet.
 It consists of a set of numbers (example: 192.168.1.1).
 Each device connected to a network is assigned a unique IP address for identification and communication.

3. MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
 A MAC address is the permanent, physical address of a device’s network card.
 It is a unique identifier set by the device manufacturer (example: 00:1B:44:11:3A:B7).
 MAC addresses operate within a local network and do not change over time.

4. Routing:
 Routing is the process of selecting the best path for data to travel across networks.
 Routers are responsible for directing data packets to their correct destinations.
 Efficient routing ensures faster and accurate delivery of data.

Conclusion:
Today’s learning provided a clear understanding of how domain names, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and routing work together to make communication over the internet possible. Attached is a visual diagram for better understanding.
